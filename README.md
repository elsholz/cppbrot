# `pybrot`
`pybrot`'s name might be a bit confusing, as the most recent implementation is based on c++.

Whereas the python version doesn't do a lot, the c++ version is a Mandelbrot explorer.
You can use the keyboard to navigate the rendering. Terminal with color support required. Uses ncurses.

## Usage
Execute `cmake-build-debug/cppbrot` or compile yourself. <br> 
To navigate aroung use VIM key bindings:
- `h` Move Left
- `j` Move Down
- `k` Move Up
- `l` Move Right
- `J` Zoom Out
- `K` Zoom In
- `+` Increase Iteration Count
- `-` Decrease Iteration Count

## Old:
pybrot renders fractals using (partly) python in the terminal
Example:
